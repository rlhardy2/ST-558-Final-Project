## Wine Quality App Overview

The app that I made uses data sets found from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The data can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).

The app has several setions and allows the user to subset and download the data, render numerical and graphical summmaries of the data, and render different predictive models for the data. The predictive models used are: multiple linear regression, regression tree, and random forest. For the predictive models, the dependent/response variable is *quality*, and other variables from the data set are used to predict the quality of the wine.

## Required Packages

The required packages for this app are:

* `shiny`
